            <p> Escaping Hell is a 2D narrative Adventure video game made in GameMaker Studio 2. <br>
                The player is a customizable character that must learn to navigate this Hellscape and maybe even find their way out of Hell. 
                The game’s main antagonist is based on the nordic Goddess Hel, whose one half resembles a girl. However her other half is decayed. 
                The player must make choices they deem correct or risk walking further into hell instead of finding a way out of it.<br>
                
                The game contains branching dialogue, an interactive storyline, a melee combat system, monsters with unique movement systems, 
                a platformer area, multiple mini games, a JSON saving system, and Steam features such as cloud saving and achievements.

            <p>This game was released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1378820/Escaping_Hell/">Steam</a> on August 20th 2020.</p>

            <h3 id = "MoonWaltz">Moon Waltz</h3>
            <p>      
                Moon Waltz was originally released in 2013 as a Flash Game by Benedikt Hummel and Marius Fietzek. 
                It is a 3 minute game, whose only input is deciding if the moon is visible at any given moment or not,
                thus turning the player into a werewolf. Based on whether or not the player is a werewolf for given events e.g. getting mugged,
                walking by a hunter, the player can achieven different endings. <br>

                Sarah Werum ported this game from ActionScript to HTML and JS using the Game making tool Phaser3 in 2020. 
                Because Moon Waltz was created on an old and now obsolete version, this consisted of recoding the entire game using the previously
                existing art assets and story logic. <br>

                Its rerelease with a new publisher is currently being negotiated.

            <p>      
                Quantum Physics Simulation is a interactive VR project made in Unity 3D as part of an Emory course on 3D Animation.
                It objects and animations were created in AutoDesk 3DS Max and it movements and interactions were written in Unity in C#.
                The Visualization includes animations of particles turning into waves and Quantum objects breaking out of Finite Potential Wells.
                The Player can interact with their environment by catching and throwing particles or by placing or removing them from Finite or Infinite Potential wells.

            <p>Monster Run, made in 2017, is a 2D Python game using the GUI simpleGUI on the page CodeSculptor and can be accessed <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user47_DEZFCnJ0ZW_9.py">here</a>.<br>
                In an interesting twist on the Mario franchise, the player is a monster from the Mario series running from Mario himself. 
                The player collects points by jumping over obstacles and collecting coins while attempting to escape his follower. 
                The player’s high score is recorded in order to test yourself against your previous attempts.

            <p>
                This Game was created on the Python site CodeSculptor in the year 2017, and can be viewed <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user47_mX0xkClzer_8.py">here</a>.<br>
                The Eight Queens Puzzle is solved by placing eight Queens on a Chess Board so that none is able to reach each other in a single move.
                Is this condition not fulfilled, the Queens in question will be marked in red.
                If all Eight Queens are placed on the board with no conflicts, the game is considered won.
                There is an easy mode that displays all the areas on the board that are considered unsafe.
