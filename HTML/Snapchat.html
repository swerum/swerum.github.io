        <p>
            While I had already been making my games and designs for a while, at Snapchat, 
            I learned to make polished, proffessional looking UX and designs. I was mentored by my peers, 
            who had studied and worked as designers for years and was able to greatly improve my design skills.
            <br><br>
            I started in the team responsible for making developer tools for Lens Studio: Templates, Asset Library scripts and Prefabs.
            In this role, my UI had to be simple and subdued to encourage developers to mentally insert their own designs. 
            My code too, had to be modular and easy to understand, while providing non-coding creators with all the tools they would need
            to create simpler experiences. 
            <br><br>
            With time, I was also able to branch into my own creative explorations. I was moved to a user experience
            focused team, where my job was to create prototypes for future projects, provide feedback for internal tools,
            support backend developers when designing new features, and write up my own feature requests for future Snapchat 
            filter mechanics and archetypes. <br>
            I used primarily Figma to make my concept art for feature proposals or for whipping up some simple UI Textures. 
            I would then create prototypes using Lens Studio and Javascript, occasionally using Blender for some more complex 3D Graphics.
            <br><br>
            Because of the exploratory nature of my job, many of my projects are not open to be shared. 
            Thus, below you'll find only the projects I worked on that have since been released to the public.

                <strong>Dialogue ML Model</strong><br>
                My first major project at Snapchat was to create a Template for developers to use when making Snapchat Lenses - aka. Filters - using the Dialogue Machine Learning Model. 
                This model can answer the user's question using a few paragraphs of context data. 
                I wrote made a comprehensive example project with helper scripts and 
                no-code customization options. In the process, I gave feedback and suggestions for future versions to the team that had made the model. 
                I then documented both the ML model and the template itself and 
                published the template for developers.

                    <strong>In Lens Digital Goods</strong><br></a>
                After Snap's tumultuous layoffs, I was chosen to take over the AR side of In Lens Digital Goods: the then upcoming ability for developers to include microtransactions in their Lenses.
                I scripted example projects and helper tools for early access developers to use, collected feedback, and helped the initial external developers to debug their code.
                Together with our client-side developers, I planned out the API calls necessary for developers to add purchasing and spending to their lenses and ensured that this important new feature 
                was not only functional, but usable for even developers with little coding experience.
